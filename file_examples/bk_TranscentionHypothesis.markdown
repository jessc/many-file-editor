q; "While today's computers still lack our structural or connectionist complexity, their vastly superior rate of learning suggests that in the forseeable future they will attain and exceed our structural complexity as well." -- John Smart
q; "Astonishingly, if current trends continue, a physical limit to computational acceleration must arrive just centuries, not millennia, from now. Quantum physicist Seth Lloyd (2000a, 2001) proposed that we will arrive at the Planck scale of computational miniaturization within the next 250-600 years, if acceleration continues at historical rates. Krauss and Starkman (2004) make similar calculations arriving at a 600 year limit to the continued acceleration of Moore's law." -- John Smart
q; "Femtotechnology: (structures below the atom in size)"
q; "Our Milky Way galaxy will merge with the Andromeda galaxy in just tens to a few hundred billions of years, and all black holes within each galaxy, including the supermassives at the core of each galaxy, will merge in a few hundred billion years thereafter."
q; "All the matter in all galaxies will end up inside merged black holes."
q; "Dark energy acceleration in between galaxies is a repulsive effect that appears to be subdividing our universe into informationally-disconnected islands"
q; "Black hole creation and passive merger can thus be seen as an attractive and potentially developmentally-constrained destination for all sufficiently advanced intelligences in universes with our physics."
q; "In this scenario, each universal civilization may be in the process of turning into something analogous to a seed, a developmental structure that packages its evolutionary history and experience in a way that transcends our apparently finite and potentially dying universe, just as seeds transcend finite and dying biological bodies."
q; "Fortunately, such claims are increasingly testable by scientific simulation."
q; "If the transcension hypothesis is correct, inner space, not outer space, is the final frontier for universal intelligence. Our destiny is density."
q; "A low-mass X-ray binary (LMXRB) star system. Strange as it seems, Earth's postbiological future may look something like this, with us inside a black hole of our own creation, on a highly accelerated path to merging with other universal civilizations doing the same thing. If true, our destiny is density!"
q; "Simple one-way messaging or probes may be not worth the cost to send, and advanced messaging or probes may provably reduce the evolutionary diversity in all civilizations receiving them, as they would condemn the receiver to transcending in a manner similar to that of the sender." -- John Smart
q; "An evolutionary system, where most processes are unpredictable and creative, and a developmental system, where a special few processes are predictable and constrained to produce far-future-specific emergent order."
q; "Gould (2002) has argued that the only broadly predictable feature of evolutionary processes is that their variety increases over time. Viewed over geologic time, the "tree of life" gains ever more branches, species, and specializations across all life-permitting environments."
q; "We can observe many physical processes in our universe that seem perennially creative, exploratory, and unpredictable (quantum mechanics, chaos, nonlinear dynamics, non-equilibrium thermodynamics), and a special subset of processes that seem highly conservative, constraining, and predictable (conservation laws, entropy, classical mechanics, stellar lifecycles, spacetime acceleration)."
q; "Astrosociology"
q; "The Transcension Hypothesis: Sufficiently Advanced Civilizations Invariably Leave Our Universe"
q; "Earth has likely developed intelligent life one to three billion years later than other Earth-like environments closer to our galactic core."
