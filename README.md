# Overview

I worked on this project for awhile as a fun learning experience but it appears Shoes is not well maintained. Many of the sample files it comes with do not work, and the documentation is scarce. Hopefully when Shoes 4 is released it will fix these issues. In the meantime, because this app was not a critical need, I'm going to wait until there is better support.


## Many File Editor

Opens a file with many near-filenames but not exactly right (for example file-name which needs to be file-name.txt), pulls out all those filenames, allows you to apply substitutions, opens those files one at a time, allows you to edit them, then saves it and goes on to the next.
