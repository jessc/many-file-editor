# Many File Editor

Opens a file with many near-filenames but not exactly right (for example file-name which needs to be file-name.txt), pulls out all those filenames, allows you to apply substitutions, opens those files one at a time, allows you to edit them, then saves it and goes on to the next.

## Overview

Uses the Ruby GUI toolkit Shoes.

Built for Mac OS X.

## Edge Cases

## Installing

## Installation

Go to the [Shoes website](http://shoesrb.com/downloads.html) and download Shoes.

## Usage

Open the Shoes app then open many_file_editor.rb.

Paste in the text of the near-filenames.

Add a Regex to change the near-filenames to proper filenames. Click "Apply Regex". This will show the new filenames in the edit box to the right.

Click 'Open Files'. The window will change to a big edit box with each file.

Edit the file, then click "Save" then "Next File" or "Previous File", depending on what you need.

Click "Exit" when you are done.
